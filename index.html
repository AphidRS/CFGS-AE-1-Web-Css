        <p>Sheree Atcheson: “Women in coding is important. It’s time to actively challenge the biases and developer stereotypes. Coding and 
            technology are integrated into everything that we do – including how we shop for groceries, consume content and get treated for 
            illnesses. If we don’t have a diverse group of people behind the solutions that we all use, then we won’t be able to create solutions 
            that meet the needs of everyone in our diverse society. We need more women in coding – and we need to create a culture that helps 
            them to stay and succeed. Appreciate, listen and actively promote them – equal opportunities and equal pay are the only way forward.”</p>

            <p>Sean Farrington: “We’re ready to take the next leap forward. Technology is pervasive and we are now in the midst of a coding revolution. 
                As we take our relationship with technology to the next level, businesses stand to reap the benefits – but only if they invest in their 
                team’s technology skill development. Developing digital skills is an ongoing process, and the skills developed at school, university, 
                or past jobs need upgrading to meet the demands of the modern organisation. Development frameworks evolve and skills have to be kept fresh. 
                Pushing a culture of learning in the realm of coding now will undoubtedly cement some certainty for the future.”</p>

    <p>Jonathan Crane: “Having an artistic background can be a huge asset, particularly when we look at where technology is going. Some of the best 
        people in software development and some of the best coders are also musicians. Writing and studying music, as well as being able to play an 
        instrument, requires great discipline and an understanding of how chords and notes go together – these composition skills are very important 
        in areas like DevOps.”
</p>
    <h3>Texto h3</h3>
    <p>Steve Thorn: “As well as a passion for IT and coding, the future coder must be a great listener, able to challenge people, have an 
        enquiring mind and be proactive. They’ll also need discretion when dealing with potentially sensitive data and have excellent attention 
        to detail to spot anomalies in data patterns. These characteristics can’t necessarily be taught at school or university. Companies are 
        increasingly looking at what candidates are like as a person, not just what’s on a piece of paper.”</p>
